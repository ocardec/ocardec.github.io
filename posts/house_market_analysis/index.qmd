Here is a quick descriptive analysis and potential regression model to build a comprehensive housing market analysis. The main purpose is to extract valuable insights related to any association between sales prices, home values, and/or additional property features and how these contribute to the overall value and sale of a property. 

### Data


The data employed here pertains to the houses found in a given California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census data. This data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices), and 


The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self explanatory:

longitude

latitude

housing_median_age

total_rooms

total_bedrooms

population

households

median_income

median_house_value

ocean_proximity
